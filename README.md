  ## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹.
I am currently learning Full Stack Web Development with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). I'm passionate about building dynamic, user-friendly web applications and continuously improving my skills.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, React Router for URL-based filtering, Axios for API calls, Chart.js for visualizations,Redux-Toolkit for state management.

**Backend:** Express.js with RESTful APIs, Mongoose for database interactions with MongoDB.

**Database:** MongoDB with models for leads, sales agents, comments, and tags.

### Project View
